According to the CDC, heart disease is a leading cause of death in the US for most races, including African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, 
and white individuals. About 47% of Americans have at least one of three key heart disease risk factors: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or smoking. 
Additional indicators include diabetes, obesity (high BMI), lack of physical activity, or excessive alcohol consumption. Detecting and preventing these 
significant heart disease factors is crucial in healthcare. Computational advancements enable the use of machine learning to identify patterns in data 
for predicting a patient's condition.

The dataset originates from the CDC and is a vital component of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). BRFSS conducts yearly telephone 
surveys to gather health status data from US residents. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and three US territories. BRFSS conducts over 400,000 adult interviews annually, making it the world's largest continuous health survey system. 
The most recent dataset, as of February 15, 2022, contains data from 2020, with 401,958 rows and 279 columns. Most columns consist of health-related 
questions posed to respondents, like inquiries about difficulty walking or smoking history. This dataset contains numerous factors, 
both direct and indirect, affecting heart disease. Consequently, I selected the most relevant variables and performed cleaning to prepare it for 
machine learning projects.
